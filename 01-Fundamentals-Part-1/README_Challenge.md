## ðŸ¥°Coding Challenge #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), <br>
which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meters).

### Your task is to write some code to help them:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables called massMark, heightMark, massJohn and heightJohn.
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula, and store the results in two variables called BMIMark and BMIJohn.
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
   whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
### Test data:
- Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95m tall.
- Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76m tall.
