# JavaScript Fundamentals Challenge – Part 1

## 🥰Coding Challenge #1
Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new gymnastics discipline, which works differently. Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so one average score per team). 

### Your task is to write some code to help them:
1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores
2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above. Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"
4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both Data 1 and Data 2
5. Ignore draws this time

### Test data:
- Data 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49
- Data 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27

## 🥰Coding Challenge #2
### Your tasks:
1. Write a function 'calcTip' that takes any bill value as an input and returns the corresponding tip, calculated based on the rules above (you can check out the code from first tip calculator challenge if you need to). Use the function type you like the most. Test the function using a bill value of 100
2. And now let's use arrays! So create an array 'bills' containing the test data below
3. Create an array 'tips' containing the tip value for each bill, calculated from the function you created before
4. Bonus: Create an array 'total' containing the total values, so the bill + tip

### Test data
- 125, 555 and 44
- part-01 challenge에서 배열로 데이터를 만들고 함수를 사용해 결과값을 출력했어서, 이번에는 약간 다르게 문제를 해결함 -> 배열 & map함수를 사용해 데이터 결과 출력

## 🥰Coding Challenge #2
### Your tasks:
Let's go back to Mark and John comparing their BMIs!<br>
This time, let's use objects to implement the calculations! Remember: BMI = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meters).

### Your tasks:
1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height (Mark Miller and John Smith). Name these objects as mark and john, and their properties exactly as fullName, mass and height.
2. Create a calcBMI method on each object to calculate the BMI (the same method on both objects). Assign the BMI value to a property, and also return it from the method.
3. Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI. Example: "John Smith's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark Miller's (23.9)!".

### Test data
- Marks weighs 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weighs 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
